# ProtoJS
ProtoJS is my personal Boilerplate I use to rapidly prototype JavaScript apps.

- __Express__ gets you going without any setup.
- __Webpack__ bundles all your modules.
- __Babel__ gives you access to the newest features of ES6.
- __ESLint__ checks your syntax and style.
- __Gulp__ makes things convenient.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies and lunch.

```
npm install
gulp dev
```

## ProtoJS and production
The included __Express__ server is not setup for production but you can use __ProtoJS__ to build production bundles.

```
gulp build
```
